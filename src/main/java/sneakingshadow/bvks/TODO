Clean up the block breaking.
Make sure it handles enchantments

Also if two stacks are split, it will leave each stack by making it check for the hovering item in inventory if you can
Make it so it can place blocks and drop event will drop items in the orb if you don't hold shift
Show extra information in gui. Have to different parts of the gui, the simple and the informal.

Make an item that will teleport back to the players inventory when dropped, then make it an enchantment.
Make the item store the players name as nbt, then make an item that will in it's class create a reference to the player, sorted by playername.
Check if you can get the player name any other way.

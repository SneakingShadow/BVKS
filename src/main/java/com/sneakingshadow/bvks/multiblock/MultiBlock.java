    /**
     * A structure block is something that will be compared to the blocks in world.
     *     Example: Blocks.cobblestone
     * This will 'convert' the block into a StructureBlock that checks for that specific block.
     * For specifying metadata on blocks, the block must be put in an ItemStack, and ItemStack damage will be used as metadata.
     *
     * You can also input your own structure block. Remember to implement everything needed specified in the StructureBlock class.
     *
     * The structure array, is the array which the multi-block will compare to the in world structure to see if it's valid.
     *
     * The structure array starts at x = 0, y = 0, z = 0.
     * A structure block will increase x by one and add it in the structure array.
     * '/' character will set x to 0, and increase z by 1.
     * '\\' character will set x and z to 0, and increase y by 1.
     *
     * ArrayLists are counted as a structure block,
     * and they can take operators, special characters, values, duplicators and modifiers, but not structure modifiers.
     * Only requires one value to be correct, doesn't matter which one.
     * Can be made by using ( and ), where everything in between is put in an ArrayList.
     * Note:
     *     Does not work in same manner as '|'.
     *     ArrayList can contain ArrayLists.
     *     both '('  ')' and "("  ")" can be used.
     *
     * A structure block can be mapped to a character, and that character could be used in place of the structure block.
     * Mapping is done by inputting:
     *     A character, that's not a special character nor operator nor modifier nor structure modifier.
     *     followed by a structure block.
     * Note:
     *     Special values, modifiers and operators are allowed, but not structure modifiers.
     *     A & B counts as one structure block.
     *     Mapping can't be done in an ArrayList
     * All the key characters would post-init be replaced by its mapped value.
     * If a character is not mapped nor a special character, it will be replaced by null.
     * A character key is used by having that character in a string.
     *
     * A structure block can be mapped to a string, that key string is called a string-object,
     * and that string-object could be used in place of the structure block.
     * Mapping is done by inputting:
     *     '^',
     *     a string,
     *     followed by a structure block.
     * Note:
     *     Special values, modifiers and operators are allowed, but not structure modifiers.
     *     A & B counts as one structure block
     *     Mapping can't be done in an ArrayList
     * All the key string would post-init be replaced by its mapped structure block.
     * If a string-object is not mapped, it will be replaced by null.
     * A string-object is used by having "^" surrounding the string.
     *     Example: "^string_key^"
     *
     * Operators and the operand(s) it takes, are regarded as one structure block.
     *
     * In a string:
     * All the characters and string-object will be added to the structure array.
     * Special characters, operators, modifiers and structure modifiers are allowed, but not duplicators.
     * Special values are of course not allowed.
     * Note:
     *     @ has to encase the ore-name if OreDictionary modifier is used.
     *         "@cobblestone@"
     *
     * OreDictionary is allowed, but must have the special character '@' before the ore-name.
     *     Example: '@', "cobblestone"
     *
     * InputList extends ArrayList<Object>, but is treated differently.
     * Everything in an InputList is treated as if it was inputted outside of the input list.
     *     new MultiBlock(new InputList(A,B,C)) = new MultiBlock(A,B,C)
     *
     * There's also duplicators, like '>' and '<'.
     * The difference between the two is that '<' is called before the unpacking of InputLists,
     * while '>' is called after the unpacking of InputLists.
     * Usage of the two operators is done by inputting:
     *     an object to duplicate,
     *     operator,
     *     amount of times to duplicate
     * Note:
     *     amount of times to duplicate has to be an integer that's above 0
     * Example:
     *     new InputList(A,B,C), '<', 2   ->   new InputList(A,B,C),new InputList(A,B,C)  ->  A,B,C,A,B,C
     *     new InputList(A,B,C), '>', 3   ->   A,B,C,C,C
     *
     * Special Characters / Values:
     *     ' ' or null = anything. doesn't matter what block it is.
     *         true
     *     '+' = full block
     *         block.isOpaqueCube()
     *     '_' = air block
     *         block.isAir(world, x,y,z)
     *     '-' = replaceable block
     *         block.isReplaceable(world,x,y,z)
     *     '~' = liquid
     *         block.getMaterial().isLiquid()
     *     '*' = opaque material
     *         block.getMaterial().isOpaque()
     *     '#' = opaque light based
     *         block.getLightOpacity(world, x,y,z) == 255
     *
     * Modifiers, in order of precedence:
     *     '@' = OreDictionary
     *         If inputted as a character, next string will be assumed to be an ore-name.
     *         If used in string, the ore-name has to be encased in @
     *
     * Mapping:
     *     '^' = string-object
     *         If inputted as a character, next string will be assumed to be a string-object.
     *         Following structure block, and modifiers in between will be mapped to the string-object.
     *         If used in string, the string-object has to be encased in ^
     *
     * Structure Modifier:
     *     '/' = next z column.
     *         z++  x=0
     *     '\' = next level up.
     *         y++  x=0  z=0
     *
     * Duplicators, in order of precedence:
     *     '<' = duplicator
     *         level 0
     *     '>' = duplicator
     *         level 1
     *     '[' = duplicator
     *         level 2
     *     ']' = duplicator
     *         level 3
     *
     *     These two take an operand before it, and an integer operand after it.
     *     It copies the value before it, the amount of times that the operand after it specifies.
     *     Note:
     *         This operand will be ignored if no integer is found, or integer is lower than 1.
     *
     * Operators, in order of precedence:
     *     '(' and ')' = Brackets
     *         Can be used in and outside of string as characters.
     *         Everything inside will be put in an ArrayList.
     *     '!' = not       takes one operand
     *         Inverts the next check
     *     '&' = and       takes two operands
     *         Both cases have to be true
     *     '|' = or        takes two operands
     *         One of the cases have to be true.
     *         If it's mapped to something, everything it's mapped to has to be the same.
     *         A, '|', B to character 'l', then everywhere l is used in place of (A, '|', B) has to yield the same result;
     *         meaning, if you get A,A,A,B it's invalid, but if it's only A or only B, then it's valid.
     *     Note:
     *         A & B & C = (A & B) & C
     *
     * Order of precedence:
     *     Duplicator, level 0
     *     Extraction of InputLists
     *     Duplicator, level 1
     *     Brackets
     *     Sort any found ArrayLists, in this order of precedence, without Structure Modifiers
     *     Modifiers
     *     Transform special characters and special values to StructureBlock
     *     Duplicator, level 2
     *     Operators
     *     Duplicator, level 3
     *     Mapping
     *     Structure Modifiers
     *
     * A multi-block that's in the shape of a furnace recipe lying down, with air block in the center:
     *     new MultiBlock("xxx/x_x/xxx", 'x', Blocks.cobblestone);
     *
     * The multiblock-object can check for structures with any orientation, by using:
     *     multiBlockObject.findStructure(World world, int x, int y, int z)
     * This returns a new Structure, or null if no structure was found.
     *
     *     findStructures(World world, int x, int y, int z)
     * Checks for all possible structures of this multiblock in world,
     * and returns an ArrayList<Structure>, that's empty if none are found.
     * This can be useful if you want to avoid overlapping structures.
     *
     * Rotation is by default set to only rotate around Y axis,
     * but this can be changed using the 'set rotation around axis' functions.
     * Rotation is per 90Â°, 1/2 pi in radians.
